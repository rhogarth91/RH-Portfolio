        manufacturing company. I have a Masters of Law (LLM) in Human Rights Law
        (Merit) and a BA Hons in Politics and International Relations (2:1) from
        the University of Nottingham. My hometown is Leeds but I am currently
        living in Newcastle Upon Tyne.

        I have always been interested in coding and have taken the plunge to
        finally start to learn some coding skills! I have completed SheCodes
        Basics and Addon, SheCodes Plus and Addon and the SheCodes AI courses so
        far. Now I am taking on the challenge of the SheCodes Responsive course.
