              This landing page promotes my work as a front-end developer so
              far.
              <br />
              <br />
              The webpages you're currently browsing were built as final project
              for the SheCodes Responsive workshop. The page showcases more
              advanced HTML, CSS, the use of Bootsrap framework as well as the
              creation of a full responsive web page to any screen size. During
              the workshop we were also shown how front-end developers build
              websites using designs from Figma. I will be going back to
              previous projects to improve on those pages using the knowledge
              gained in this workshop as well as keep this page up-to-date with
              my latest projects - so watch this space!

              This app shows the user the current weather as well as a 5-day
              forecast for any city in the world.
              <br />
              <br />
              I coded the page as part of the SheCodes Plus workshop and was my
              first attempt at building a page that combined HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript alongside an API for live weather data. The project
              also has a search function to allow the user to type in any city
              in the world and the current weather will be displayed. The date
              and time displayed on the page is the user’s date and time
              according to their time zone. I did improve upon the project after
              completing the SheCodes Add On course (see my World Clock app) by
              making the time tick rather than it being static. I also learned
              how to use GitHub and Netlify to host my code and projects.

              This app uses AI to generate book suggestions based on the users
              input.

              <br />
              I coded the page as part of the SheCodes AI Add-on workshop. I
              learned all about AI and the power of this very growing tool. It
              was interesting to see how we could integrate and use AI alongside
              our code to create more responsive and effective HTML pages. I
              learned how to create AI prompts that would generate meaningful
              replies to the user’s inputs. The project is linked to an AI API
              and a JavaScript plugin.

              This page was built as part of the SheCodes Monthly Challenges and
              was my first-ever submission to the website's challenge page. This
              is my first solo project and my first attempt at building a themed
              landing page. The page showcases the HTML, CSS, JavaScript skills
              I have learned so far. I will be going back to improve the page as
              I learn more coding skills. My favourtie feature is the innerHTML
              function that allows the user to choose the light or dark side of
              force!

              I coded the page as part of the SheCodes Plus Add-on workshop.
              This project I used the skills I had learned in the SheCodes Plus
              workshop but then built upon them by including new features such
              as a drop-down list, replacing all the innerHTML with what the
              user has selected from the dropdown, adding a link to return to
              the homepage and linking the project to a CDN, namely Monment.js.
