              This app allows users to search for any word and using an API the
              page returns a dictionary definition of that searhced word.
              <br />
              <br />
              This workshop built on the skills learnt during the React
              workshop. I coded a dictionary app with search engine that
              includes API integration to return accurate results for the users
              search. Not only does it return the definition but includes a grid
              images of the searched word.

              This app shows the user the current weather anywhere in the world.
              The page was built using React coding and intergrates a weather
              API.
              <br />
              <br />
              I built a weather app with a search engine that returns live data
              for the users searched city. The live data is sourced from a
              weather API. The weather icons are animated! This is the first
              time I have included an animated feature within one of my coded
              pages. The page looks pretty simple but the code certinaly is not!
              I enojoyed learning a new coding language in Recat.

              This was my first attempt at building a page using a Figma design
              - just like a front-end developer would do if they had been hired
              to create a landing page! To create the page, I had to implement
              all the skills I have learnt in previous workshops as well as grow
              in confidence in using Figma as a design tool. I learned how to
              embed HTML links as part of this workshop. The creation of this
              landing page was super exciting challenge and the resulted in the
              most professional looking landing page I have created to date.

              This landing page promotes my work as a front-end developer so
              far.
              <br />
              <br />
              The landing page you're currently browsing was built as my final
              project for the SheCodes Responsive workshop. The page showcases
              more advanced HTML, CSS, the use of Bootsrap framework as well as
              the creation of a full responsive web page to fit any screen size.
              We also learnt about SEO and how this can be used to optimise your
              page on search engines. During the workshop we were also shown how
              front-end developers build websites using designs from Figma.

              This app shows the user the current weather as well as a 5-day
              forecast for any city in the world.
              <br />
              <br />
              This was my first attempt at building a page that combined HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript alongside an API for live weather data. The
              project has a search function to allow the user to type in any
              city in the world and the current weather will be displayed. The
              date and time displayed on the page is the user’s date and time
              according to their time zone. I did improve upon the project after
              completing the SheCodes Add-On course (see my World Clock app) by
              making the time tick rather than it being static. I also learned
              how to use GitHub and Netlify to host my code and projects.

              <br />
              For this project I learned about AI and the power of this growing
              tool. It was interesting to see how we could integrate and use AI
              alongside our code to create more responsive and effective HTML
              pages. I learned how to create AI prompts that would generate
              meaningful replies to the user’s inputs. The project is linked to
              an AI API and a JavaScript plugin.

              at building a themed landing page. The page showcases the HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript skills I have learned so far. I have included two
              images of the page to illstrate my first submission versus my
              current and improved page. The web page will continue to be
              improved as I learn more coding skills. My favourtie feature is
              the innerHTML function that allows the user to choose the light or
              dark side of force!

              This project I used the skills I had learned in the SheCodes Plus
              workshop but then built upon them by including new features such
              as a drop-down list, replacing all the innerHTML with what the
              user has selected from the dropdown, adding a link to return to
              the homepage and linking the project to a CDN, namely Monment.js.
